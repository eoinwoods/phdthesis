# Eoin Woods' PhD Thesis
This Github repository holds the LaTeX source code for Eoin Woods' PhD thesis completed at the [University of East London](https://www.eclab.uel.ac.uk/) between early 2012 and late 2018 under the supervision of [Dr Rabih Bashroush](https://www.uel.ac.uk/staff/b/rabih-bashroush).

The title of the thesis is _Addressing Energy Efficiency in System Design: A Journey From
 Architecture to Operation_ and the work investigates a number of aspects of how software architects can influence the energy efficiency of the systems that they design.
 
The thesis was submitted in September 2018 and successfully defended at a viva voce examination in November 2018.  The degree was awarded on 22nd January 2019.

The final version of the thesis can be found in the [UEL ROAR repository](http://roar.uel.ac.uk/7951/).

The thesis code is based on the "Thesis" template from [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/thesis/graduate-thesis) which in turn is apparently based on the legendary "ECS template" created by [Professor Steve Gunn](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/srg) from the [Department of Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southhampton](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk).  A number of changes have been made to comply with UEL's PhD thesis guidelines.
