\subsection{Architectural Prioritisation}

The refined model is now ready for dissemination to the practitioner community to see if it proves as useful in practice as our survey of the preliminary model suggests.  To reach the practitioner community, we will publish the model in a less formal style via posts on mainstream Internet sites (such as medium.com, LinkedIn and Twitter).  We will also try to publish a summary of it in practitioner-oriented publications and publicise it through conference sessions at practitioner conferences, if it proves to be of interest to programme selection committees.

After practitioner oriented publication, we are also interested in extending the Stage 3 questionnaire to architects in other geographical locations to compare and explore whether they react in the same way to the model as their colleagues in Europe and the Americas.

Beyond this, it would be interesting to survey practitioners who have used the model in the future, after they have been using it for some time.  This would allow us to understand whether its usefulness was borne out in practice and to find out what the practitioners are actually using it for (for example, whether it is used more as a training aid or as a personal aide memoir) and which industries and architectural job types are using it.
