\chapter{Validation of Application Energy Monitoring}

Explaining and reporting testing.  Validation involves running scenarios and using Apollo to get answers.  Then create another way of estimating the resource usage of the "transactions" independently and comparing the two.  For example, run multiple services on one machine, burn 10 sec of CPU in one, 20 sec in the other, then in an enclosing window, Apollo should be reporting a ratio of 2:1 for their usage.
